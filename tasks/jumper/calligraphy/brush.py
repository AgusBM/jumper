"""The brush in the carried claw: a thick handle gripped by the closed claw, and a
black tuft of hair that may sink into the floor.

## Where it sits

In `LF_palm_link`'s frame the palm runs along +y to y = 0.144 m, the fixed jaw is
on +z and the finger closes from -z. The handle is 13 mm thick and lies along the
fixed jaw's channel (`MOUTH_Z`), and the finger closes **onto** it. Measured on
the V1.6 visual meshes along the handle's whole length, and the largest 无 the
reach band then holds (`write.py`, the legs held, 2026-10-09):

    FINGER_HOLD   finger against the handle   无
       0.10       6.4 mm into it               13.6 cm   the finger's limit; the
                                                         claw closed through the brush
       0.00       3.3 mm into it               13.6 cm
      -0.025      0.8 mm into it -- touching   12.2 cm
      -0.05       1.7 mm clear                 10.6 cm

Opening it costs size because the finger's tip hangs lower and meets the floor in
more of the writing poses. The handle starts at y = 55 mm, inside the mouth: from
30 mm it ran 2.4 mm into the finger's hinge at any opening.

The brush is **welded to the palm**, not held by the finger's friction: a grip
that could slip would turn every stroke into a measurement of the grip.

## The hair, and why nothing collides

The hair is black, tip down. It does not collide with anything: when it was a
colliding tip, pressing it into the floor pushed back on the arm, the trunk
turned under it and the stroke wandered (无's long middle stroke turned the
trunk 48 deg with a fixed-depth press). Now the tip is simply put **below** the
floor, the way wet hair splays, and the ink is the hair's section at the floor:
`section_width`. Deeper is wider; nothing pushes the robot.

## Its shape

As wide as the handle at its base and bellied towards a point, like a real
brush's (笔肚, 笔锋): `hair_radius`. As a straight cone that wide, its section
grows only in proportion to the depth, and the share of it under the floor is
the stroke's width over the base's whatever the lean -- 58% of its length for a
7.8 mm stroke (median; 84% at the heads, 跳跳, claw2_tt, 2026-10-10), a brush
seen sunk into the stone. Bellied, the section widens fastest near the tip.
