"""`jumper.five_foot`'s deploy library against the robot it mirrors.

`tasks/jumper/five_foot/deploy/lib.rs` carries the claw on the right by showing
the policy the robot reflected in its x-z plane (see its docstring). Its two
tables -- which joint is whose twin, and which keep their sign -- are written in
Rust, and nothing on the robot can check them: a wrong sign is a joint driven
the wrong way by a policy that is otherwise working perfectly. So they are held
here against the two things that decide them, the table training mirrors with
and the model's own joint axes.

The mirror arithmetic itself is the library's own tests (`cargo test` in
`deploy/fsm`), which compile it in as the controller does.
